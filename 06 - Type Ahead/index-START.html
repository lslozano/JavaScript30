//This is the json file which includes all the data that we need. It is a huge array.
const endpoint = 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29/raw/2bf258763cdddd704f8ffd3ea9a3e81d25e2c6f6/cities.json';

//We create an empty array where we will store the data coming from the endpoint.
const cities = [];

//The browser now has a new function built in to get data called: Fetch.
//The description is function fetch (input: requestinfo )
//So here, we pass our endpoint.
/*
Fetch itself returns a promise, so, in other words is that something will eventually come back from this promise.
To work with it we need a .then.
The then will returns to us a "blob" of data. It is called like this because it doesn't know what kind of data
it is.
We explicitly know it is a json.
So we need to convert the blob into a json. If you look at this blob 
in the console, you can see it has a method called json. So we access this method and execute it in
order to convert the blob to a json.
This in fact returns another promise, so again we use .then and pass the data we will receive.
The data will be the massive array that conforms the endpoint.

My first approach to get all this data inside cities, was to make a .forEach in the data and for each city,
push that element into my cities array. And it works, but there is a cleaner way.

Instead of doing a for each, we just apply the push method to cities and pass the data with a spread operator.
So we now have individual arguments to be pushed into our cities array.
*/
fetch(endpoint)
  .then(blob => blob.json())
  .then(data => cities.push(...data))
  //.then(data => data.forEach(city => {cities.push(city)}));

/*
Now we need to create a function to find the match of the word that is being written in our input file.
This function will have two parameters: wordToMatch and ciites.
We need to return the cities by applying a filter to them.
This filter will have a place.
Create a constant that consist in a new Regular Expression. 
This regular expression will receive a string as it's first argument. This string will be searched for and it is
the pattern.
The 'gi' is the modifier. 
G stands for global and i serves to modify the search to be case-insensitive.
Now that we have our regular expression contained in regex, within the return  we execute another
return, this will return the place, accessing the city and the method match, searching to match regex
OR the state.
*/
function findMatches(wordToMatch, cities) {
  return cities.filter(place => {
    //Here we need to figure out if the city or state matches what was searched.
    const regex = new RegExp(wordToMatch, 'gi');
    return place.city.match(regex) || place.state.match(regex)
  })
}

//This function helps to add commas to the numbers in population. It is a regular expression.
//Black magic.
function numberWithCommas(x) {
  return x.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',');
}

/*
Now we make our function to display the matches. Before doing this, it is important to get our
data.
Every time we need to get our data, then occupy ourselves in displaying it.

Create a constant that contains the function findMatches and as the wordToMatch receives this.value
which is the input that is being received by the user in the input field.
It will search within the cities array as a second argument.

For the fun part:

Create an html constant that is equal to the matchArray previously declared and execute the map
method on it.
This map method will have an element called place.
It will return the following:

A constant named regex equal to a new Regular Expresion, that will have this.value (the value of
the input) as it's first argument (string that will be searched for) and 'gi' as it's second.

A constant named cityName that will be equal to the place, accessing the city and the replace method.
The replace method will replace our regex with the declared span.

A constant named stateName that will do the exact same thing but for the information in state.

Now return a list element containing a class name and the cityName and stateName constants.
Also a span with class population that has the numberWithCommas to return the place population
number with the commas placed in the exact place.
To finish, the map returns an array but we want a string, so
we access the method join('') to create the desired string.


Last but not least, in this function we grab the constant suggestions, access the innerHTMl property
and make it equal to our html constant. This way we can create the list elements with the corresponding
values and add them to our html on the fly.

*/
function displayMatches() {
  //GET YOUR DATA FIRST.
  const matchArray = findMatches(this.value, cities)
  const html = matchArray.map(place => {
    const regex = new RegExp(this.value, 'gi')
    const cityName = place.city.replace(regex, `<span class=hl>${this.value}</span>`)
    const stateName = place.state.replace(regex, `<span class=hl>${this.value}</span>`)
    return `
      <li>
        <span class="name">${cityName}, ${stateName}</span>
        <span class="population">${numberWithCommas(place.population)}</span>
      </li>

}

/*
The functions declared above will not work if we do not get ahold of the classes search and suggestions and
add to them event listeners for when to execute the functions.
So in order to do that, first we declared the constants and via query selector we grab ahold of those
classes.

Now, we add an event listener that will be listening for change and keyup and for each will execute 
displayMatches function.
Again, we do not add parenthesis at the end of displayMatches since we want just to make a reference to
the function and execute it once the event happens. Not at the moment the screen loads.
