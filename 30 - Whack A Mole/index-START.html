  // So we need to be certain that the mouse click came from the user.
  // When the isTrusted is true. Add to the score of the user.

/*
IMPORTANT NOTE:
I discovered that there is no use for getting hold of all the elements that have a class of hold, since you can add
the class up directly to each mole. You just need to change the css to apply the style to every element that has the class of
mole and up.

If you use the holes node list you are not adding the class up directly to the mole element, but to the parent node element which
is the div that contains the classes of hole and hole1, hole2, etc.
So when you try to remove the class up when doing the click on the mole element, it won't work because that element doesn't have a 
class up associated to it.
You need to access the parent node of the instanced element and from there, remove the class up.
