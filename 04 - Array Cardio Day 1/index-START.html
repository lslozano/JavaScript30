    /*
    We declare a constant that will be a new array containing only the elements that pass our specific test.
    Since we only need the inventors who were born in the 1500's, we need to apply a filter method in the 
    inventors array.
    It will check each of the elements in the inventors array and since everyone of them is an object
    with different keys, we select the key named year.
    In our conditions, we check if year is equal or greater than 1500 and equal or less than 1599.
    Every element that pass this tests, will form our new array called fifteenHundred

    Wes Bos first approach was as follows:

      if (inventor.year >= 1500 && inventor.year <= 1599) {
        return true

    We declare a constant called fullNames that will be an array containing only the first and last name 
    of each inventor. To do this, we set it's value as the inventors array accessing the method map and returning
    a string formed by inventor first name and last name. We do this using back ticks and string interpolation.
    So in each iteration, it will give us a string element containing this two values.

    For this we declare a constant named sort. We give it the value of inventors and access the sort 
    method of the array and compare element one to element two.

    If a - b equals 0, they stay the same.

    We then establish the total of years lived and the inventor. 
    To get the desired result we add up total to the difference between the year where the inventor passed and the year it was born, giving as a result
    the number of years each inventor lived.
    It is important to note that since the first time around we do not have a total, it will be undefined. So we need to specify it's value to 0

    This was my first approach but after watching the video I realized it is wrong, since it only adds up the birthdates of each inventors

    The way this is setup is from more years lived to less years lived.

    Now to find all the Boulevards that contain the word 'de' we create a constant called de equal to the links applying map method (returning a new

    As a next step, we again do this but for the nextPerson.
    Now we have hold of the last names of element in the array person.
