    // Exercise: Reference vs Copy

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2)
    age = 200
    // 200 100 Value of age at line 13 is stored in age2.
    // It doesn't update the other one.
    console.log(age, age2) 

    let name = 'Luis'
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2)
    name = 'Manuel'
    console.log(name, name2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players
    console.log(team, players)
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    //team[3] = 'Luis'
    //console.log(players)
    // If you update an array it will always reference back to the
    // original.
    // So line 38 is updating the array players.
    // In order to do so, we need to make a copy rather than a reference.


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // Will the elements in the array as a new array.
    // If no parameters are specified, it returns the whole array.
    const team2 = players.slice()

    team2[3] = 'Luis'
    console.log(players, team2)

    // Another way to do this is using concat method.
    team3 = [].concat(players)
    console.log(team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = "Yeeehaaa!"
    console.log(team4, players)

    // We can make a new array using the method .from.

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[3] = 'cool'
    console.log(team5)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // We do a reference to the original, not a copy.
    // const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99
    // console.log(captain.number)
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // Using the assign method from object.
    // Create an empty object.
    // Pass as a second argument the object we want to copy from.
    // As a third argument, we can pass the properties we need to update or create new ones.
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

    // Spread operator for objects. Copies into a new one.
    const cap3 = {...person}
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const ls = {
      name: 'ls',
      age: '1000',
      social: {
        github: 'lslozano'
      }
    };

    console.clear()
    console.log(ls)

    // Copy of ls - As said before, Object.assign only goes one level deep.
    const dev = Object.assign({}, ls);
    // Update man. Does not affect ls object.
    dev.name = 'man'
    console.log(dev.name, ls.name)

    // If we were to update dev.social.twitter, it will affect
    // ls object, since it is a reference, not a copy. This happens because, as said, it goes
    // one level deep only.
    // Even the object spread operator only goes one level deep.

    // If I really need to do a clone, I need to go online and find a function called:
    // cloneDeep.

    // A poor mans deep clone - not recommended:
    // Turns the JSON into string.
    // Inmediatly after, transforms it back into a JSON.
    // This creates a copy and not a reference.
    const dev4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(ls));
