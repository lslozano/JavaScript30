<!--
  This was my first approach to remove the class .playing once my div contained it, but this way it was
  removed immediatly and the desired effect did not happen.

    window.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    const key = document.querySelector(`.key[data-key = "${e.keyCode}"]`);
    if (key.classList.contains('playing')) {
      key.classList.remove('playing')
    }
  });
