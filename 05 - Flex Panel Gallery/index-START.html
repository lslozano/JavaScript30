    This class is for all the panels.
    Step 1: 
    First of all we need that our panels are displayed side by side and we do that by adding a display: flex to the class panels.
    */
    .panels {
      min-height: 100vh;
      overflow: hidden;
      display: flex;
    }

    /*
    Step 2: 
    This class applies style to individual panels. 
    Now that we added display: flex to all the panels, we have an issue to solve. 
    They are side by side, but they only occupy as much room as the flex child needs, this means it is as big as the words inside them.
    So at this point we are going to have an empty space on the right side of the screen. 
    To solve this, we add flex: 1. This means that each of the panels will evenly distribute the extra space among each other. 
    At this point, the extra space in between them is distributed.
    Now what we need is that the items are centered in thirds. 
    */

    /*
    Step 4: 
    To achieve our aim that the words are vertically positioned and centered we need to do the following: 
    We add the properties of justify-content: center, so our items get centered left to right. 
    Then we add align-items: center. This won't get us much, but this needs to be added in order for the items to align themselves 
    vertically (from up to down) when we add the corresponding properties. 
    Next step is to make our individual container a flex container by adding display: flex. This display: flex is a nested flex box.
    The flex container is "panels" and the flex item is "panel". But, the flex item can also be a flex container, as seen in this 
    example. 
    An element in CSS can be a flex container as well as a flex item.
    At this point, our words are stacked left to right, but we need them in a vertical position. 
    The only thing we need to do is add flex-direction property and set it as column. And now the words are vertically centered in the middle. 
    Now we want each of this items to occupy 1/3 of the panel container. We need to head to our Flex Item container that selects all the children , 
    this means the class .panel > *.

    /*This exercise leans heavily on CSS and a little JS.*/
    /* Flex Items */
    /*
    Step 3:
    To see what is happening, we can add a border with 1px solid and a red color. This way we have a visual representation
    of what is happening with each children element on the screen. 
    .panel > * selects ALL the direct children within the panel class. > children selector of a particular element. 
    * universal selector.
    Note: Later on we will delete this border. 
    At this point, our three items have borders around them. 
    */

    /*
    Step 5: 
    We can add a temporary border to see clearly what is happening with each item in the container. 
    To make the items spread in 1/3 across our panel container we use the property flex: 1 0 auto. 
    This property sets the flexible length on flexible items. 
    It's three values are: flex-grow, which is a number specifying how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items. 
    flex-shrink, which is a number specifying how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items. 
    flex-basis, which is the lenght of the item. Legal values: "auto", "inherit" or a number followed by a "%", "px", "em" or any other
    length unit.
    So, the flex property we added tells the items to grow in 1/3 of our panel container, shrink 0 and auto establishes the length. 
    We add a display: flex on our panel container, effectively adding a nested flexbox, turning the container panel within the container panels, in it's
    own flex container.
    This makes the items align to the left of the container, not doing much, but if we add justify-content center, centering our
    items left to right and align-items center, to align them vertically. 
    We no have everything centered. 
    */
    .panel > * {
      margin: 0;
      width: 100%;
      transition: transform 0.5s;
      flex: 1 0 auto;
      /*Nested flexbox*/
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }

    /*
    Step 6: 
    To move the first and last letters in the column to the very top and the bottom respectively, we need to create another selector
    that grabs the first child and last child in each panel.
    This selectors, in combination with Javascript, will help us make the transition effect that we aim to have. 
    First, we need to get ahold of the first children and last children in the panel class. 
    We do this by creating a selector of the panel, that grabs all the elements inside with the universal selector and only targets
    the first-child and last child. 
    Now that we did this, inside curly braces we use transform, which is a CSS property that lets you rotate, scale, skew or translate 
    an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model. 
    So, we translateY on the first child to -100%, removing it out of the visual space of our screen. 
    And, we do the same for the last child, transalating Y to 100%.
    At this point, we do not see this two children on screen since they are below and above the measures of Y axis that are visible
    on the screen. 

    The idea is that when you remove the translateY, our children elements animate in on the screen. When adding it again, they animate
    out of the screen. 
    The way that this is done is by adding a class open-active to each panel and when they have this class, we use the transform property
    on the first and last child to translate Y to 0. 

    You might be wondering, what does .panel.open-active means? Because this is very different than .panel .open-active.
    Well, the difference is the following: 
    .panel .open-active selects all the elements that have this class that are direct descendants of the element that has the class
    .panel 
    .panel.open-active will select all elements that have the class panel and open active.

    At this point, if we go to our developer tools Elements section and add a class of .open-active in a div that has the panel class,
    we will see the effect in motion. 
  
    */
    .panel > *:first-child { transform: translateY(-100%); }
    .panel.open-active > *:first-child { transform: translateY(0); }
    .panel > *:last-child {transform: translateY(100%)}
    .panel.open-active > *:last-child { transform: translateY(0); }

    .panel p {
      text-transform: uppercase;
      font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive;
      text-shadow: 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.72), 0 0 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45);
      font-size: 2em;
    }
    
    .panel p:nth-child(2) {
      font-size: 4em;
    }

    /*
    Step 7: 
    The last bit of the puzzle is that when our panels have the class of open, the text needs to be bigger and the panel needs to
    stretch out.
    To do this, we create a selector that targets all the elements that have the class of panel and open. 
    It has the property font-size 40px so our text becomes bigger and we give it the property flex with a value of 5.
    This value means that it will grow, as the first value in flex correspondends to flex-grow.
    So, it will take 5 times the extra room as the rest of them, because they, have a regular flex of 1 (at least when they do not
    have the .open class.) So, at last we have our animation transition. 
    This happens because, if you go to the panel class, it has the property transition that transitions the font size over 0.7 
    seconds and also uses the cubic-bezier value. 
    This is also applied to the flex property. 
    */
    .panel.open {
      flex: 5;
      font-size: 40px;
    }

    .cta {
      color: white;
      text-decoration: none;
    }

    /*
    Step 8: The CSS is done, time to add our JavaScript.

    First, we declare a constant that selects all the elements that have the panel class. This will give us a Node List.

    We create a function called toggleOpen that will select our object itself (meaning the panel wich the user clicks - this
    will be defined later on) and access the classList and the toggle method to add and remove a class name from the element.
    This will add and remove the class "open". For when the panel is open, the text changes it's font and has a flex of 5.

    Now to achieve the effect of bringing the first children and last children into the screen, we create a function called
    toogleActive that will receive an event as a parameter.
    On this event we will check if it includes a property with a name "flex" 
    This is done by writing a conditional if statement. On the condition, we will access the property names of the event and check
    if it includes the property name "flex", if that is true, 
    add to the panel element the class name of 'open-active'.
    This will work the other way around, when the class is present, it will remove it.
    */

    const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel');

    function toggleOpen() {
      this.classList.toggle('open')
    };

    /*
    It is important to note that in this function we check if it includes the word "flex" in a property, since it is the one that matters and
    that is added when the class "open" is present. On some browsers this property is read as flex or flex-grow. To cover all the possibilites
    we just check if it includes the word flex.
    */
    function toggleActive(e) {
      if(e.propertyName.includes('flex')) {
        this.classList.toggle('open-active')
      }
    };

    /*
    Step 9: 
    We have our functionality to toggle the open and open-active classes, but how do we achieve this? 
    Well, by accessing our panels constant and since the Node list has the method forEach, we can iterate over it's elements and
    do the following:

    For starters, on each element in the panel we will add an event listener, that will listen for a click.
    Whenever a click happens, it will execute our toggleOpen function.
    If another click occurs, it will again execute our function toggleOpen and remove the class "open".

    Last but not least, we do another forEach and add an event listener for the "transitionend", which can be find in the event that is
    being activated by the toogleActive function.
    If you want to check it out, you can do a console.log(e) to see what is happening.
    So when the trasnitionend happens, it will execute our function toggleActive.
    
    We do not add parenthesis to the functions so they do not execute on load, we just refer to them so they execute when the
    event that each listener is listening to, happens.

    Note: You do not have to specify a width for the elements, because if the have a flex of 5, each will take less space of the
    extra room. 

    */

    panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('click', toggleOpen));
    panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('transitionend', toggleActive));
