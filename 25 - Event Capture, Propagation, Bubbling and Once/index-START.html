  // Exercise on event capture, propagation, bubblign and once.

/*
The propagation is bidirectional, from the window to the event target and back. 
This propagation can be divided into three phases:

From the window to the event target parent: this is the capture phase
The event target itself: this is the target phase
From the event target parent back to the window: the bubble phase

All modern browsers have event bubbling as the default way of event flow.
Modern browsers do not support event capturing by default but we can achieve that
by code in Javascript, passing a third argument to the event listener. This
third argument is an object which will have a property of capture to true.

Event capture and event bubbling is the foundation of event handler
and event delegation in Javascript.

Event capture occurs when the browser is figuring what the user
clicked on and goes from outtermost element to innermost until
it finds the matching one.
If capture is set to true, each time an evet listener with the same
name is found in the path to the one that originated, it will trigger
the event.

Event bubbling is when the event that was triggered is reached 
and to display the effect to the user goes all the way out from the
nested element to the window.
So, when event bubbling occurs, it will ripple all the way up through the DOM Tree
and again, each time an event is found with the same name, as it is travelling back in the DOM Tree
will be triggered.
*/


  const divs = document.querySelectorAll('div')

  function logtext(event) {
    console.log(this.classList.value)
    // This stops event bubbling from happening, so only
    // the event on the element that triggered it occurs.
    // And not anymore events that are higher in the DOM Tree.
    event.stopPropagation()
  };

  // Event listener can receive a third argument, which is an options 
  // object where we can tell if the capture property of the event
  // will be true. Capture by default is false.
  divs.forEach(div => div.addEventListener('click', logtext));

/*
  Example of an event listener with the third argument setting the capture property
  to true. As said, by default is false. And with the once property set to true.
  Once make the event only available to happen "once" and then unbinds itself.
    divs.forEach(div => div.addEventListener('click', logtext, {
      capture: true,
      once: true
    }));
*/ 

// Capture: Run the function on the way down.
// Bubbling: Run the function on the way up.

// There is also a property option of the third argument of the addEventListener
// which is once.
// If set to true, once the event occurs, it will unbind itself.
// This is the same as removing an event listener:
// div.removeEventListener('click', logText);
// So it will listen for the click once, and it will unbind itself
// so there is no further event to be triggered.

// Setting a once property on our button. This can be helpfull for 
// store checkouts in eCommerce sites.
const button = document.querySelector('button')

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('You can click me only once!')
  }, {
  once: true
});
